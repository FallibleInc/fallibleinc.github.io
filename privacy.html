                </h2>
            <p class="privacy-text">When visiting the Website and/or using the Services, you may provide us with certain types of information, as described below. Except as described in this Policy, Fallible never collects personally identifying information from the user.
            </p>
            <p class="dividing-text">Registration (Sign-Up)</p>
            <p class="privacy-text">In order to use the Services, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration, a user may be required to give contact information such as first and last name, company name, address, email address, job function, phone number, mobile number, URL and/or IP addresses. We use this information to verify the ownership of servers, URL, and IP addresses, to do non-invasive informational testing of users' servers, and to contact the user about Services for which they have expressed interest. In order to use the Services, users must provide a username and password. </p>
            <p class="dividing-text">User Payment Information</p>
            <p class="privacy-text">When users order the Service, they must provide payment information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for one-time and recurring billing purposes according to the type of Services ordered and the terms pertaining thereto , and to fulfill users' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, personal information is used to contact the user. Payment information is stored in encrypted format, as more fully detailed below (see Security) and is used only to send to our credit card processor, for the purposes of collecting payment for Services rendered or to be rendered. We never make this information visible to anyone other than our credit card processor and never communicate it over a non-encrypted connection. The full credit card number is never seen by anyone inside our company, once entered and submitted, except by the credit card processor for the purposes of authorizing, clearing and reversing charges to your credit card. </p>
            <p class="dividing-text">Delivery of Services</p>
            <p class="privacy-text">Fallible's Services collect information about servers connected to the IPs or URLs given by the users during the registration process. IP's and URL's are checked to verify users' authority to require security vulnerability testing. No security vulnerability data is collected until the user requests it. Users can start and stop the Fallible's scan and data collection process by changing their settings in their Account Settings web page available on the Website to users. Fallible only collects information that can be accessed from the internet about users' computer(s) and/or that is provided by users via phone and/or e-mail and does not install software on the users' computer for this purpose. </p>
            <p class="dividing-text">User Profile</p>
            <p class="privacy-text">We store personally identifying information that we collect, and log files to create a profile of our users. Users' profile is used to tailor users' visit to our Website.</p>
            <p class="dividing-text">Cookies</p>
            <p class="privacy-text">When you visit Fallible, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search.

However, some Fallible features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Fallible only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties. Some of our business partners, such as Google Analytics and any third parties serving advertisements to our website, may use cookies on our Website in the future, and such cookies may collect anonymous traffic data. However, we will have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>
            <p class="dividing-text">Log Files</p>
            <p class="privacy-text">Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Session's Ids, IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifying information in our database, except as entered by the user during registration. Session IDs and IP addresses entered during registration time by the user are tied to personally identifying information to enable the provision of our Services.</p>
            <p class="dividing-text">User Communications</p>
            <p class="privacy-text">When you send email or other communications to Fallible, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

            <p class="dividing-text">Supplementation of Information</p>
            <p class="privacy-text">In order for the Website to properly function, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we collect with information from certain 3rd party sources, including Google Analytics and our credit card processor.

                <br>
                <br> Payment information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) and information about the security vulnerability of users' website is protected, by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the aforementioned information when viewed online.
                <br>
                <br> While on a secured page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just surfing.
                <br>
                <br> In addition, we limit access to personally identifying information to employees who we believe reasonably need to receive such information to provide our Services or in order to do their jobs and take other precautions we deem reasonable to protect the security of users' personally identifying information.
                <br>
                <br> However, users should be aware that we cannot fully guarantee the security of their personally identifying information. As in many computer systems, internet applications and software programs, unauthorized use, failure of hardware or software, etc. may be injuriousness to the confidentiality of users' personally identifying information.If users have any questions about security, please contact hello@fallible.co
