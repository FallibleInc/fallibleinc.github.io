<h3> What Information Do We Collect, and How is it Used?</h3>
<div>When visiting the Website and/or using the Services, you may provide us with certain types of information, as described below. Except as described in this Policy, Fallible never collects personally identifying information from the user.

<br><br><subheading>Registration (Sign-Up)</subheading><br>
In order to use the Services, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration, a user may be required to give contact information such as first and last name, company name, address, email address, job function, phone number, mobile number, URL and/or IP addresses. We use this information to verify the ownership of servers, URL, and IP addresses, to do non-invasive informational testing of users' servers, and to contact the user about Services for which they have expressed interest. In order to use the Services, users must provide a username and password.

<br><br><subheading>User Payment Information</subheading><br>

When users order the Service, they must provide payment information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for one-time and recurring billing purposes according to the type of Services ordered and the terms pertaining thereto , and to fulfill users' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, personal information is used to contact the user. Payment information is stored in encrypted format, as more fully detailed below (see Security) and is used only to send to our credit card processor, for the purposes of collecting payment for Services rendered or to be rendered. We never make this information visible to anyone other than our credit card processor and never communicate it over a non-encrypted connection. The full credit card number is never seen by anyone inside our company, once entered and submitted, except by the credit card processor for the purposes of authorizing, clearing and reversing charges to your credit card.

 <br><br><subheading>Delivery of Services</subheading><br>
 Fallible's Services collect information about servers connected to the IPs or URLs given by the users during the registration process. IP's and URL's are checked to verify users' authority to require security vulnerability testing. No security vulnerability data is collected until the user requests it. Users can start and stop the Fallible's scan and data collection process by changing their settings in their Account Settings web page available on the Website to users. Fallible only collects information that can be accessed from the internet about users' computer(s) and/or that is provided by users via phone and/or e-mail and does not install software on the users' computer for this purpose.
